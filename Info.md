# Potential Errors (Dependencies)

When installing PyAudio, portaudio needs to be installed first:
`brew install portaudio`.

# WAV files

WAV files <= 10 have special jobs.

0 - "This number was not recognised"
3, 2, 1 - Me saying the numbers 3, 2, and 1 respectively.
4 - "Recording in"
5 - "Please say a natural number, now:"
10 - Spare number (Must stay spare)

WAV files > 10 are audio files that can be linked to chocolate bars.
This is because numbers that are spoken in 1 syllable are not picked up by the speech to text.
