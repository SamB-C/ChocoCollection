# Potential Errors (Dependencies)

When installing PyAudio, portaudio needs to be installed first:
`brew install portaudio`.

# WAV files

WAV files <= 10 have special jobs.

0 - Error message indicating that a number wasn't recognised.
3, 2, 1 - Me saying the numbers 3, 2, and 1 respectively.

WAV files > 10 are audio files that can be linked to chocolate bars.
This is because numbers that are spoken in 1 syllable are not picked up by the speech to text.
